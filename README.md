## About Me

As a Full Stack Developer at The Orange Club Digital Agency, my journey post-graduation from Capital University of Science & Technology has been about creating impactful digital products. Leveraging a Bachelor of Science in Computer Software Engineering, I apply agile methodologies to tackle complex challenges, always aiming for excellence in user experience and system functionality.

A strong foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies allows me to develop comprehensive solutions. My skills are not just technical; they reflect a commitment to continuous learning and skill development, ensuring that the solutions we deliver are not only innovative but also sustainable and forward-thinking.
When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring the latest technology trends or enjoying a good cup of coffee.
